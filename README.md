Banking Dashboard – Power BI Project
This Power BI project, titled "Banking Dashboard", presents a comprehensive analysis of customer banking data to uncover trends, risk factors, and product usage behavior. The dashboard includes visualizations that explore variables such as income bands, credit card ownership, risk weighting, loyalty classification, and more—segmented by demographics like gender and nationality.

The aim of this project is to demonstrate my data analysis and visualization skills using Power BI, with a focus on delivering clear insights that can support decision-making in the banking and financial services domain.
